Effective Date: January 1, 2025
Document Classification: INTERNAL - COMPLIANCE

================================================================================
1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE
================================================================================

This policy establishes the requirements for periodic review of user access 
rights to ensure that access permissions remain appropriate and aligned with 
job responsibilities. This policy applies to all systems, applications, and 
data repositories within the organization, with particular emphasis on payment 
processing systems.

Scope:
- All employees, contractors, and third-party vendors

  databases, and administrative portals

The organization shall conduct regular access reviews to:
- Verify that user access rights are appropriate for current job functions
- Identify and remove unnecessary or excessive access privileges
- Detect and remediate orphaned accounts (accounts for terminated employees)
- Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements (PCI-DSS, SWIFT CSP, GDPR)
- Maintain the principle of least privilege

================================================================================
3. ACCESS REVIEW REQUIREMENTS
